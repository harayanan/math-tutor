    question: 'A pizza is cut into 4 equal slices. You eat 1 slice. What fraction of the pizza did you eat?',
    answer: '1/4',
    options: ['1/2', '1/3', '1/4', '1/8'],
    hint1: 'The bottom number (denominator) is the total number of slices.',
    hint2: 'You ate 1 slice out of 4 total. Write that as a fraction: slices eaten over total slices.',
    explanation: 'The pizza has 4 equal slices and you ate 1, so the fraction is 1/4. The numerator (top) is what you ate, and the denominator (bottom) is the total.',
