    explanation:
      'Let x = number of ₹500 notes. Then (10 - x) = number of ₹200 notes. 500x + 200(10 - x) = 2600. 500x + 2000 - 200x = 2600. 300x = 600. x = 2. So there are 2 notes of ₹500 and 8 notes of ₹200. Check: 2 × 500 + 8 × 200 = 1000 + 1600 = 2600.',

      'x + y = 15 and 200x + 100y = 2500. Substituting y = 15 - x: 200x + 100(15 - x) = 2500. 200x + 1500 - 100x = 2500. 100x = 1000. x = 10. So Vikram has 10 notes of ₹200 and 5 notes of ₹100.',

    explanation:
      'False. Every Indian note denomination is a multiple of 10, so any combination of notes will always give a total that is a multiple of 10. Since ₹999 is not a multiple of 10, it cannot be paid using only notes.',
